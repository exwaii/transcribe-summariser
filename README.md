# transcribe-summariser

something for my personal use. too much video/audio content available online to probably parse through, this helps me determine the general gist of a video to see if its something im interested in. uses whisper to convert audio to text, then summarises with chatgpt. downloads youtube file as audio too.

in the future would like to implement a proper ui, incorporate timestamps and grab subtitles that already exist.
