# transcribe-summariser

something for my personal use. there is too much video/audio content available online and too little time - this helps me determine the general gist of a video, and whether its worth watching. 

uses whisper to convert audio to text, then summarises with chatgpt. downloads audio of youtube videos locally.

would like to implement a proper ui, incorporate timestamps and grab subtitles in the future.
